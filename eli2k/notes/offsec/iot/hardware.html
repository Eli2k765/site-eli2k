                attempt a very brief overview of approaching
                hardware from a security PoV</p><strong>Last
                updated: March 5th, 2023</strong>

                  <div id="contain">
                    <h2>Recon</h2>
                    <h3>Searching</h3>
                    <div>
                      <p>As with most engagements, this one starts
                      with research. One of the best places to
                      quickly find images and manuals for a device is
                      by searching for the devices FCC ID on <a href=
                      "https://fccid.io">fccid.io</a>. The FCC ID
                      will likely be on the label of the device.
                      Occasionally you can also find public research
                      that has already been done on a device on
                      hobbyist forums.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h2>Teardown</h2>
                    <h3>Enclosure Bypass</h3>
                    <div>
                      <p>Determine what is needed to open the casing
                      of a device. It may be the case that the device
                      can be opened by some pressure, if there seems
                      to be glue holding the case together, use a
                      heat gun to melt the glue. If the device has
                      rubber pads there may be screws beneath them.
                      As a last resort you can attempt to cut or
                      force the device open.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h2>Exploitation</h2>
                    <h3>Chips and Parts</h3>
                    <div>
                      <p>You can start by identifying different chips
                      and part numbers. Google will help you find
                      corresponding datasheets that give more info
                      and may hint at what protocol it works on.</p>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Interfaces</h3>
                    <div>
                      <h4>UART</h4>
                      <div>
                        <p>UART interfaces are usually in a pair of 3
                        or 4 where one of the pins are a GND. You can
                        identify the GND by placing the black probe on
                        any metal part of the device and placing the
                        red probes on the four pads. The beeping pin is
                        GND. To identify the other pins you can place
                        the black probe on the ground and turn the
                        device on. While the device is on, place the
                        red probe on the other pins. The pin with
                        constant high voltage is the Vcc pin. Reboot
                        the device and place the red probe over the
                        remaining two pins. The pin that fluctuates is
                        the Tx pin and the low voltage pin is Rx. You
                        can then use the Attify Badge to connect to
                        UART and use a usb to connect to your PC.</p>
                        <p>To interact with the console you need to
                        identify the baudrate via trial and error
                        although commonly it's 9600, 38400, 19200,
                        57600 or 115200. Once you've identified the
                        baudrate you can use the screen command:
                        <code>screen /dev/ttyUSB0 38400</code> From
                        here you can reboot the device and access the
                        debug logs to identify the booting process. You
                        may be able to get bootloader access while the
                        device is booting or find a way to get a root
                        shell.</p>
                      </div>
                      <h4>SPI</h4>
                      <div>
                        <p>The SPI flash chip will usually have a
                        component number on it that will allow you to
                        find a datasheet. You can use a SOIC clip and
                        Attify Badge to connect the device to your
                        computer. Using spiflash.py will allow us to
                        read with: <code>spiflash.py -s 5120000
                        --read=new.bin</code> and write with
                        <code>spiflash.py -s 5120000 -w
                        new.bin</code></p>
                      </div>
                      <h4>JTAG</h4>
                      <div>
                        <p>Usually a set of 6, 12, 13 or 20 pin headers
                        that may be spread across the board. If the IoT
                        device is not running a full-fledged OS or the
                        hardware does not provide a serial interface, a
                        lower-level debug approach, JTAG, is usually
                        available. We can connect in a similar manner
                        to the other interfaces. Using OpenOCD will
                        allow us to read and write data to the
                        target.</p>
