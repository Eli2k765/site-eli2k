                <p class="alert">How to obtain and hack
                firmware.</p><strong>Last updated: May 4th, 2023</strong>
                <article>
                  <div id="contain">
                    <h3>Obtaining</h3>
                    <div>
                      <h4>Just Google it</h4>
                      <div>
                        <p>The first step to testing firmware is
                        obtaining it. Oftentimes this as simple as
                        visiting the vendors websites, forums or
                        hobbyist forums.</p>
                      </div>
                      <h4>Dumping from Flash Chips</h4>
                      <div>
                        <p>Sometimes it will require a bit more
                        digging. If the firmware you want to test is on
                        a local device, you can usually open it up and
                        identify the chip containing the firmware.
                        Usually this chip will be small and have eight
                        pins connecting it to the board. Google will be
                        your friend when identifying the chip and what
                        each pin is for. In order to dump the firmware
                        from this point, you'll need a microcontroller
                        that can communicate with SPI chips, such as
                        the Attify Badge. Once you have connected the
                        pins to the microcontroller you will need to
                        connect your microcontroller to your computer.
                        You can use a script like spiflash.py to dump
                        the firmware.</p>
                      </div>
                      <h4>OTA DFU Sniffing</h4>
                      <div>
                        <p>Another scenario where you can grab firmware
                        is by dumping an Over-the-Air
                        Device-Firmware-Update. For this to be viable,
                        the device traffic must be over HTTP if traffic
                        is being captured by a transparent proxy such
                        as Burp. If the device traffic is encrypted
                        then traffic must be captured in a MitM
                        scenario.</p>
                      </div>
                    </div>
                      <h3>Encrypted</h3>
                      <div>
                      <h4>XOR</h4>
                      <div>
                        <p>Coming across encrypted firmware is becoming
                        more common. The most common form of encryption
                        for firmware is just a simple XOR. You can
                        identify XOR'd firmware by the repitition of
                        strings when viewing the hexdump</p>
                      </div>
                      <h4>Not XOR</h4>
                      <div>
                        <p>In the case that the firmware is not XOR'd
                        an attacker must perform manual analysis using
                        a disassembler or dump from memory while the
                        firmware is decrypted.</p>
                      </div>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Not Encrypted</h3>
                    <div>
                      <h4>Extracting and Analysing</h4>
                      <div>
                        <p>Occasionally, you will obtain unencrypted
                        firmware. This makes analysis quite a bit
                        easier. Running <code>binwalk -e
                        firmware.bin</code> will extract the file
                        system</p>
                        <h5>Hardcoded Secrets</h5>
                        <div>
                          <p>I usually start off by looking for
                          configuration files and identifying any
                          hardcoded credentials or certificates. You can
                          do this manually or with a tool such as
                          firmwalker.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h5>Dissassemble</h5>
                        <div>
                          <p>I like using radare2 to check for strings
                          and functions in the individual binaries of the
                          firmware. You can also use radare to easily
                          search for Xrefs to system(). It may be
                          possible to identify backdoors or injection
                          vulns here too.</p>
                        </div>
                        <h5>Emulation Station</h5>
                        <div>
                          <p>We can emulate the binaries here to allow us
                          to find overflow vulns. <code>sudo chroot .
                          ./qemu-arch -L optional-lib-path -g gdb-port
                          binary.bin</code> will get the binary running
                          and attach it to gdb-multiarch. At this point I
                          set breakpoints at strcmp and other functions.
                          If I find an overflow vulnerability I will
                          usually exploit it using a ROP chain.</p>

                      <h4>Modifying with FMK</h4>
                      <div>
                        <h5>Extracting and Backdooring</h5>
                        <div>
                          <p>Using Firmware-Mod-Kit will allow us to
                          upload a modified version of the firmware to
                          the device allowing us to check if there are
                          integrity checks. First we extract the firmware
                          with <code>extract-firmware.sh</code>. Then we
                          can add a backdoor or bindshell to the firmware
                          and build it with <code>./build-firmware.sh
                          -nopad -min</code></p>
                        </div>
                        <h5>Uploading</h5>
                        <div>
                          <p>Now we can upload the firmware to the device
                          and determine if there are any integrity
                          checks, if there are, we can try to identify
                          where it's checking for signature verification
                          and see if there is a way to bypass it.</p>
