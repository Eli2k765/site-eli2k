                    <h3>Identifying Vulnerabilities</h3>
                    <div>
                      <h4>How do they occur?</h4>
                      <div>
                        <p>Input vulnerabilities occur when an application fails to properly validate and sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a vulnerable manner. This can happen when the application does not have adequate input validation mechanisms or when the input is processed in an unsafe manner, allowing an attacker to inject carefully crafted malicious input.</p>
                      </div>
                      <h4>What tech is in use?</h4>
                      <div>
                        <p>The occurrence of input vulnerabilities are dependent on the technologies and frameworks used in the application. For example, for SQLi to be a valid attack, there needs to be a database system that processes the attackers payload and for SSTI, there needs to be a templating engine. Of course some vulnerabilities have broader requirements for occuring such as Command Injection or XSS. It's important to identify the tech in use to improve efficiency.</p>
                      </div>
                      <h4>Where does the app take input?</h4>
                      <div>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Understanding data flow</li>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Understanding how user-supplied data flows through the application can help trace how the input is processed, stored, and ultimately utilized allowing the attacker to identify potential points of interest that can be manipulated or where malicious data can be injected.</li>
                          </ul>
                          <li>Identifying vectors for attack</li>
                          <ul>
                            <li>By knowing where the app takes input, attackers can assess which vectors are available to them. Below I've included a table that demonstrates common vectors for different vuln types.</li>
                          </ul>
                        </ul>
                      </div>
                      <h4>What preventions are in place?</h4>
                      <div>
                        <p>Once I've identified likely vectors, I try to determine what preventions are in place. Below I talk about this process in detail. Knowing the preventions will determine the feasability/difficulty of the attack and help in developing a working PoC.</p>
                      </div>
                      <h4>Can you escalate?</h4>
                      <div>
                        <p>Once I have a PoC, I determine if the issue can be escalated, this usually involves a lot of research into disclosed vulns and is highly specific to the occurence of the vulnerability.</p>
                      </div>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Filters</h3>
                    <div>
                      <h4>Determining Filters</h4>
                      <div>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Observation, Testing and Analysis</li>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Interact with the application and analyze its responses: Submit various inputs (both normal and malicious) and observe how the application handles them. Look for any patterns or indications of input validation or filtering.</li>
                            <li>Pay attention to error messages and unexpected behaviors: Examine error messages returned by the application to identify any clues about the types of input filtering in place. Note any unusual or unexpected behaviors exhibited by the application.</li>
                            <li>Attempt simple bypasses and use the result to determine modifications necessary to a payload.</li>
                          </ul>
                        </ul>
                      </div>
