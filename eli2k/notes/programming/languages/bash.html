                        <h2>One-Liners</h2>
                        <p>Bash one-liners are lines of code that
                        can be executed on a single line in a bash
                        terminal. They typically use loops, pipes,
                        output redirections and many other useful
                        methods for automating repetitive tasks in
                        the shell. While writing this, I found a
                        super useful series that can be used as a
                        reference when creating bash one-liners
                        called: "<a href=
                        "https://catonmat.net/books" target=
                        "_blank">Next up – Bash One-Liners</a>"
                        near the bottom of the page. I highly
                        recommend reading each post in the bash
                        section thoroughly as much of what is
                        talked about I use or come across
                        daily.</p>
                        <h2>Shell Scripts</h2>
                        <h3>Shebang</h3>
                        <p>Bash files will start with a shebang.
                        You can read about them here: <a href=
                        "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)"
                        target="_blank">Shebang_(Unix)</a></p>
                        <h3>Variables</h3>
                        <p>In bash there are local variables, which
                        are only available within the block of code
                        where they are defined and global
                        variables, which we will cover below and
                        are also called environment variables.</p>
                        <p>Here is an example defining and calling
                        a local variable</p>
                        <pre><code class=
                        "language-bash">#!/bin/bash
exampleVar="Hello"
echo $exampleVar</code></pre>
                        <h3>Environment Variables</h3>
                        <p>An environment is an array of strings
                        that are passed to a program when the
                        program is executed. Environment variables
                        are the key-value pairs that make up that
                        array and provide information about the
                        system.</p>
                        <p>You can check the current env vars
                        with:</p>
                        <pre><code class=
                        "language-bash">printenv</code></pre>Running
                        commands with sudo will change, add and
                        remove some vars while in the elevated
                        environment, this can be observed by
                        running:
                        <pre><code class=
                        "language-bash">sudo printenv</code></pre>Keep
                        this in mind when making scripts meant to
                        run with sudo.
                        <p>Setting environment variables can be
                        done with:</p>
                        <pre><code class=
                        "language-bash">export &lt;KEY&gt;=&lt;VALUE&gt;</code></pre>
                        <p>Bash has positional variables. $0 is the
                        name of the program. $n are the arguments
                        where n is a number &gt;= 1. These
                        arguments are defined when the program is
                        executed on the commandline and can then be
                        called in a script.</p>
                        <pre><code class=
                        "language-bash">/usr/bin/cat program.sh
#!/bin/bash
printf "The program you are running is $0 \n $3 $1$2"
</code></pre>
                        <pre><code class=
                        "language-bash">./program.sh  world ! Hello

The program you are running is /home/erodgers/Desktop/eli2k/program.sh
Hello world!⏎</code></pre>
                        <p>Bash has a few special variables. This
                        post talks about them and gives examples:

                        <p>Bash has prompt variables. This post

                        <h3>Loops</h3>
                        <p>Read through the following post and
                        answer the questions below:</p><a href=
                        "https://www.shell-tips.com/bash/loops/#gsc.tab=0"
                        target="_blank">What is the Right Way to do
                        Bash Loops?</a>
                        <p>Questions:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>How do you iterate over a list of
                          files? How about lines in a file?</li>
                          <li>What are the four types of iteration
                          constructs? Describe how each of those
                          can be implemented in bash, feel free to
                          make scripts for each.</li>
                          <li>What are the <code>break</code>
                          keyword and <code>continue</code>
                          keywords used for?</li>
                          <li>How would you perform a do-while loop
                          in bash?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This challenge is optional if you were
                        able to answer and implement the questions
                        above. It is quite fun and will prepare you
                        for the next challenge so I do recommend
                        doing it: <a href=

                        Use Bash Arrays</a>
                        <p>Attempt to answer these questions after
                        reading that post:</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>What are the two types of arrays in
                          bash and how are they declared?</li>
                          <li>How do you reference an item stored
                          in an array?</li>
                          <li>How do you remove a key from an
                          array?</li>
                          <li>How do you loop over an array?</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Now that you're familiar with loops and
                        arrays do these challenges:</p>

                        <h3>Functions</h3>
                        <p>For our last topic in bash you will be
                        learning about functions. I won't be
                        providing any problems for this one, but I
                        do suggest you challenge yourself in a way
                        you see fit. The recommended reading is

                        <p>There is a lot more to bash than what I
                        showed here but hopefully this will get you
                        started.</p>
