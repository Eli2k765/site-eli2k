                <p class="alert">This class was a drag, you may learn quite a bit, but if you are anything like me, it will be boring. Don't let that stop you though, the course instructor, Tony Robinson, was very helpful and pointed me in the direction of the CyberVista practice exams which aligned almost perfectly with the exam.</p>

                        <div>
                          <p>The ITIL Service Value System (SVS)
                          outlines how an organization's components
                          and activities work together to create
                          value. The SVS interfaces with other
                          organizations to form an ecosystem that
                          benefits all stakeholders. The inputs to
                          the SVS are opportunity and demand, which
                          leads to the creation of value, represented
                          by the perceived benefits, usefulness, and
                          importance of a product or service. The
                          ITIL SVS can create value for a wide range
                          of stakeholders.</p>
                          <p>The SVS includes the following
                          components:</p>

                              strategies, type of work, or management

                                should be standardized and automated to
