                            <ul>
                              <li>Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption.</li>
                              <li>Sharing or transporting the key securely between entities is a challenge.</li>
                              <li>Diffie-Hellman is a popular key exchange algorithm used to exchange secret keys.</li>
                              <li>S-boxes are used in secret key ciphers to perform substitution during the encryption process.</li>
                              <li>All current cipher codes can be cracked, and the work factor is used to measure the security of a code.</li>
                              <li>Salting is the process of adding an initialization vector to the ciphering process to ensure that the ciphertext does not give the original plaintext when played back.</li>

                            <li>Symmetric encryption</li>

                              <li>There are two types of symmetric encryption: Block and Stream.</li>
                              <li>Symmetric block encryption groups data into blocks and encrypts them, while stream encryption encrypts one bit at a time.</li>
                              <li>Padding is used in block encryption to fill blocks to operating size when data doesn't fit perfectly.</li>
                              <li>Block cipher modes include ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB, and CTR.</li>
                              <li>IVs refer random value used to initialize the encryption process, which is combined with the key to generate the keystream.</li>

                            <li>Process: producing a fixed-length output (message digest) from a variable-length input</li>
                            <li>Weakness: same input produces the same output unless salt is applied</li>
                            <li>Factors affecting hash signatures:</li>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Collision: when two different inputs produce the same hash signature</li>
                              <li>Similar context attack: when part of the message has some significance to the original</li>
                              <li>Full context attack: where an alternative message is created with the same hash signature and has a direct relatio</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>APR1 format: addresses brute force attacks on MD5 by iterating the hash value 1,000 times</li>
                            <li>SHA weakness: does not have a salted value, making it vulnerable to rainbow table and brute force attacks</li>
                            <li>HMAC: a message authentication code that can be used to verify integrity of a message and involves hashing the message with a secret key</li>
                          </ul>

                            <li>Uses a key pair (public and private) for encryption and decryption.</li>
                            <li>Only the public key should be shared or distributed.</li>
                            <li>Is secure but often too slow for real-time communications.</li>
                            <li>Main applications are identity checking and key protection.</li>
                          </ul>
                        </div>
                        <h3>Public key encryption algorithms</h3>
                        <div>
                          <ul>
                            <li>RSA is based on the difficulty of factorizing products of large prime numbers.</li>
                            <li>Homomorphic encryption allows performing mathematical operations on ciphered values.</li>
                            <li>Elliptic Curve is an improved solution over RSA with smaller keys and more difficult curves to crack. Bitcoins use Elliptic Curve cryptography with 32-byte private keys and 64-byte public keys.</li>
                            <li>El Gamal is a public key method for encryption and digital signing, using discrete logarithms.</li>
                            <li>Cramer-Shoup is an extension of El Gamal with a one-way hashing method to protect against attacks.</li>
                            <li>The Paillier cryptosystem supports homomorphic encryption.</li>
                          </ul>
                        </div>
                        <h3>Secret Key Exchange</h3>
                        <div>
                          <ul>
                            <li>Secret-key encryption's major problem is passing the key between entities.</li>
                            <li>Two methods for key exchange in symmetric cryptography are key exchange algorithms and public key encryption.</li>
                            <li>Forward secrecy is important in key exchange, preventing compromise of long-term keys from compromising previous session keys.</li>
                            <li>Ephemeral key methods use a different key for each connection, preventing all associated session keys from being breached if a long-term key is leaked.</li>
                            <li>Diffie-Hellman is a widely used key exchange algorithm, but a weakness was discovered in its use of two popular parameters.</li>
                            <li>DHE_EXPORT Downgrade attack involves forcing key negotiation to default to 512-bit prime numbers, but it can be combated by disabling export cipher suites, using ECDHE, or using a strong group.</li>
                            <li>Diffie-Hellman has three groups with varying sizes of prime numbers.</li>
                            <li>Diffie-Hellman suffers from man-in-the-middle attacks, but public key encryption is an improved method.</li>
                            <li>The strength of Diffie-Hellman depends on the size of the prime number bases used.</li>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Select None if you do not want to use perfect forward secrecy.</li>
