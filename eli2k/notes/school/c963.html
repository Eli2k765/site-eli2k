                <h1>C963 - American Politics and the US
                Constitution</h1>
                <p class="alert">During the 2020 presidential election cycle, my roommate, who had recently moved from Vietnam, passionately discussed the intricacies of the American election process. It became apparent that he was more knowledgeable about it than I was, despite having lived in the U.S. my whole life and participating in every election I could. I felt a sense of shame for not seeking out this information on my own. Taking this class has been reminiscent of those conversations, but it has also provided me with a valuable opportunity to gain a deeper understanding and greater appreciation for the legal and voting systems that shape our country and their historical origins.</p>
