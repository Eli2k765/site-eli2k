                        <h2>Web Dev Fundamentals</h2>
                        <h3>CSS and Graphics</h3>
                        <div>
                          <h4>Specificity</h4>
                          <div>
                            <p>CSS specificity is the set of rules that
                            determine which CSS styles are applied to
                            an HTML element when multiple CSS rules are
                            targeting the same element with conflicting
                            styles.</p>
                            <p>CSS specificity is based on the number
                            and type of selectors used in a CSS rule.
                            Specificity is calculated by assigning a
                            weight to each selector and then combining
                            the weights to determine which rule takes
                            precedence. The order of precedence in CSS
                            specificity is:</p>
                            <ol>
                              <li>Inline styles - Styles that are
                              applied directly to an HTML element using
                              the style attribute.</li>
                              <li>ID selectors - Selectors that target
                              an HTML element by its ID attribute.</li>
                              <li>Class selectors, attribute selectors,
                              and pseudo-classes - Selectors that
                              target an HTML element by its class
                              attribute, attribute values, or state
                              (such as :hover).</li>
                              <li>Element selectors and pseudo-elements
                              - Selectors that target HTML elements by
                              their tag name or by a specific part of
                              an element (such as ::before and
                              ::after).
                                <p>If two or more CSS rules have the
                                same level of specificity, then the
                                rule that appears last in the CSS
                                document will take precedence.</p>
                              </li>
                            </ol>
                          </div>
                          <h4>Inheritance</h4>
                          <div>
                            <p>Is the ability of child elements to
                            inherit CSS styles from their parent
                            elements. This means that if a style is
                            applied to a parent element, all of its
                            child elements will inherit that style by
                            default. For example, if a font size is set
                            on the body element, all text inside the
                            body will inherit that font size unless a
                            more specific style is applied to override
                            it.</p>
                          </div>
                          <h4>Cascading</h4>
                          <div>
                            <p>Is the process by which styles are
                            applied to HTML elements based on their
                            specificity and order in the CSS document.
                            When there are conflicting styles targeting
                            the same element, the style with the
                            highest specificity takes precedence. If
                            two styles have the same specificity, the
                            style that appears last in the CSS document
                            will take precedence.</p>
                          </div>
                          <h4>!important rule</h4>
                          <div>
                            <p>overrides other styles, even if they
                          have higher specificity</p>
                          </div>
                          <h4>SASS</h4>
                          <div>
                            <p>SASS helps to make writing and managing
                            CSS more efficient and scalable, allowing
                            developers to write cleaner, more
                            organized, and maintainable code. Some of
                            the key features of SASS include:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li>Variables: Allows developers to store
                              and reuse values throughout their
                              stylesheets.</li>
                              <li>Nesting: Provides a way to write more
                              organized and readable styles by nesting
                              selectors within one another.</li>
                              <li>Mixins: Allows developers to define
                              and reuse sets of CSS declarations across
                              their stylesheets.</li>
                              <li>Inheritance: Provides a way to create
                              a hierarchical relationship between CSS
                              classes, allowing one class to inherit
                              styles from another.</li>
                              <li>Functions: Provides a way to write
                              reusable code that can be used to perform
                              calculations or manipulate values in
                              CSS.</li>
                            </ul>
                          </div>
                          <h4>GIF89a v. GIF87a</h4>
                          <div>
                            <p>GIF89a is an updated version of the
                            GIF87a format that supports transparent
                            backgrounds, animation loops, and
                            additional features.</p>
                          </div>
                          <h4>float</h4>
                          <div>
                            <p>The float property in CSS is used to
                            position an element to the left or right of
                            its container, allowing text and other
                            elements to wrap around it.</p>
                            <h4>Image interlacing</h4>
                            <p>Image interlacing is a technique used to
                            load images gradually, where a
                            low-resolution version of the image is
                            displayed first and then progressively more
                            detailed versions are added until the full
                            image is displayed.</p>
                          </div>
                        </div>
                        <h3>Integrating HTML, CSS, and Media</h3>
                        <div>
                          <h4>video element</h4>
                          <div>
                            <p>The video element is used to embed video
                            content into a web page, allowing users to
                            play, pause, and control the playback of
                            video files directly in the browser without
                            the need for a separate video player.</p>

var myDivObject = new Object();
myDivObject.element = myDiv;
myDivObject.color = "blue";
myDivObject.showColor = function() {
  alert(this.color);
};</code></pre>
                            <p>In this example, we first use the
                            <code>getElementById()</code> method to get
                            the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element with
                            an ID of "myDiv". We then create a new
                            JavaScript object called
                            <code>myDivObject</code>, which has three
                            properties:</p>
                            <ul>
                              <li><code>element</code> - This property
                              contains a reference to the DOM element
                              that we retrieved earlier.</li>
                              <li><code>color</code> - This property
                              stores the color "blue".</li>
                              <li><code>showColor()</code> - This is a
                              method that displays the value of the
                              <code>color</code> property in an alert
                              dialog box.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Now we can use the
                            <code>myDivObject</code> object to
                            manipulate the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>
                            element and its properties. For example, we
                            could change the color of the element like
                            this:</p>
                            <pre><code class="language-js">
                myDivObject.element.style.backgroundColor = "red";</code></pre>
                            <p>This would change the background color
                            of the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element to
                            red. We could also call the
                            <code>showColor()</code> method to display
                            the color property in an alert dialog
                            box:</p>
                            <pre><code class="language-js">myDivObject.showColor();</code></pre>
                            <p>This would display the message "blue" in
                            an alert dialog box.</p>
