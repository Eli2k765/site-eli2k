                <p>TryHackMe recently released a good blog on this: <a href="https://tryhackme.com/resources/blog/free_path">Free Intro to Cyber</a>. It goes along with a lot of this post and can be done independently or as a supplement to this post.</p>
                <p>A simple collection of resources can be found at: <a href="https://eli2k.com/cyberResources.pdf">My Cyber Resources</a>.
                <p>If you live in the United States and are a citizen without a Bachelor's/Master's Degree, I recommend heading over to <a href="https://www.wgu.edu/online-it-degrees.html">WGU's website</a>. I'm currently enrolled in the BSCIA there and it follows along with many of my recommendations in this post.</p>

                          from each other significantly. TCP is

                          Once you start using a language regularly
                          you can compare the LXYM pages to the
