                <h1>eCPPT Review</h1>
                <p class="alert">I recently passed the eCPPT exam,
                below you'll find my timeline, my tips and some
                resources I'd recommend viewing before attempting
                the exam.</p><strong>Last updated: May 4th, 2023</strong>
                <article>
                  <div id="contain">
                  <h3>What's on the eCPPT?</h3>
                  <div>
                    <p>This exam is primarily designed to test your
                    ability to comprehend a network environment,
                    which makes it somewhat challenging to prepare
                    for. While the lab machines may be easy to
                    compromise, the network itself is much more
                    difficult to navigate.</p>
                    <p>To pass this exam, you'll need to be able to
                    accurately identify web vulnerabilities and
                    possess the necessary skills to easily complete
                    an easy-rated box on HackTheBox. If you're
                    confident in both of these areas, it's time to
                    dive into the details of tunneling, routing, and
                    pivoting. In my opinion, the best way to do this
                    is by creating a home lab consisting of at least
                    three machines, each on a different NAT network
                    with different subnets. You can set this up using
                    VirtualBox. At the bottom of this page, you'll
                    find a video that demonstrates this process and
                    guides you through compromising each network. The
                    final skill you'll need is the ability to
                    generate shellcode and understand simple
                    stack-based buffer overflows.</p>
                  </div>
                  <h3>My Thoughts on the Exam</h3>
                  <div>
                    <h4>Content</h4>
                    <p>Overall, the exam felt a little dated,
                    especially compared to the labs being released on
                    HTB or THM recently. If you've been able to
                    compromise the easy-medium machines on HTB you
                    shouldn't have a problem with the labs here. The
                    network itself was complicated for me to figure
                    out because I didn't prepare enough, if you
                    bought the course I'm pretty sure it's covered in
                    there. If not set up a home lab. You will at
                    least need a Windows lab with Immunity to get
                    through the BoF.</p>
                    <h4>Difficulty</h4>
                    <p>There were a few curve balls. I certainly was
                    unprepared for the network situation and think
                    this is the most difficult part of the exam. If
                    this was a 24 hour exam like the OSCP I would've
                    failed, the additional time gave me a chance to
                    do more researh and learn while in the
                    environment. I'd recommend having a strong
                    understanding of routing, the difference between
                    bind and reverse shells, how to pivot and tunnel
                    and how to use metasploit, it helped so much with
                    routing and initial access.</p>
