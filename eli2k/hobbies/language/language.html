                <h1>Language Learning</h1>
                <p class="alert">In this post, I'll briefly talk
                about my approach to learning natural languages. I
                try to optimize the process by learning as much as
                possible about a target language (TL) in my native
                language (NL) and then immersing myself in the
                language as much as possible, in a way that is
                relevant to my use-case. If you want to see a
                practical implementation of this, head over to my
                page about <a href=

                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <h3>General Methodology</h3>
                    <div>
                      <p>To start, familiarize yourself with the
                      social norms, conventions, and customs of the
                      target language and culture. Depending on your
                      situation, there are two paths to take. If you
                      are surrounded by native speakers and have
                      access to the language, focus on building your
                      vocabulary. If you don't have access to the
                      language, focus on grammar instead.</p>
                      <p>Grammar includes learning about sentence
                      structure, rules for nouns and articles, verb
                      conjugation, usage of adverbs and adjectives,
                      pronouns, filler words, negation, conjunctions,
                      and how to ask and answer questions. For
                      building your vocabulary, it's recommended to
                      start with question words and negation. Then,
                      move on to nouns related to food and places,
                      followed by words that describe food, places,
                      people, and emotions. Lastly, focus on
                      vocabulary that is specific to your needs and
                      usage.</p>

                    Proficiency</h3>
                    <div>
                      <h4>Cultural Knowledge</h4>
                      <div>
                        <p>As it is not necessary to know the language
                        to gain insights into the culture of the people
                        who speak it, this can serve as a great
                        starting point. To immerse oneself in the
                        language and comprehend the people who speak it
                        better, it is crucial to prioritize certain
                        things.</p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>Greetings and social customs: Study the
                          common greetings and social customs of the
                          culture, such as how they address others, and
                          what is considered polite or impolite
                          behavior.</li>
                          <li>Nonverbal communication: Observe the
                          nonverbal communication patterns in the
                          culture, such as eye contact, gestures, and
                          body language, and learn how they are used in
                          different situations.</li>
                          <li>Social norms: Learn about the social
                          norms of the culture, including the role of
                          personal space, appropriate dress, and table
                          manners.</li>
                          <li>Values and beliefs: Study the values and
                          beliefs of the culture, such as attitudes
                          towards time, the importance of family, and
                          views on individualism and collectivism.</li>
                          <li>Festivals and holidays: Familiarize
                          yourself with the main festivals and holidays
                          celebrated in the culture, as well as their
                          significance and cultural meaning today.</li>
                          <li>Art and literature: Learn about the
                          history of media and what is significant
                          today. What are the biggest influences on the
                          TL's cultural and pop media?</li>
                        </ul>
                      </div>
                      <h4>Grammar</h4>
                      <div>
                        <p>Grammar serves as the fundamental building
                        block of every language. While one can
                        passively absorb numerous grammar rules by
                        watching TV, listening to music, or conversing
                        with friends, there are certain essential
                        aspects that one must grasp to gain a headstart
                        with any language. Understanding how these
                        rules influence the meaning of what is being
                        said is crucial.</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li>Basic sentence structure: Familiarize
                          yourself with the basic word order and
                          sentence structure of the TL, including
                          subject-verb-object (SVO) and
                          subject-verb-subject (SVS) sentence
                          structures.</li>
                          <li>Nouns and articles: Learn the basic rules
                          for using nouns and articles in the TL, such
                          as gender and number agreement, as well as
                          the use of definite and indefinite
                          articles.</li>
                          <li>Verbs: Study the conjugation of regular
                          and irregular verbs, including the present
                          tense, past tense, and future tense, as well
                          as common verb phrases and idiomatic
                          expressions.</li>
                          <li>Adjectives and adverbs: Learn the basic
                          rules for using adjectives and adverbs,
                          including agreement with the nouns and verbs
                          they modify, as well as word order in
                          sentences.</li>
                          <li>Pronouns: Study the different types of

                          possessive, and reflexive pronouns, and learn
                          how they are used in different contexts.</li>
                          <li>Negation: Learn the basic rules for
                          negating sentences in the target language,

                          negative verb conjugations.</li>
                          <li>Conjugation: Study the conjugation of
                          verbs in different tenses, moods, and

                          tense, future tense, subjunctive mood, and
                          perfect aspect.</li>
                          <li>Simple questions and answers: Learn the
                          basic rules for asking and answering simple
                          questions in the TL, including the use of
                          question words and question tags.</li>
                        </ol>
                      </div>
                      <h4>Vocabulary and Pronunciation</h4>
                      <div>
                        <p>While learning a language's grammar is
                        important, it's essential to familiarize
                        yourself with its vocabulary. Make sure you
                        understand the context of the words you come
                        across and practice speaking them out loud. You
                        can do this in the presence of a native speaker
                        or by closely mimicking their pronunciation. In
                        addition to grammatical words, there are many
                        everyday words that vary from person to person,
                        depending on their profession or background.
                        For instance, a chef's vocabulary differs from
                        that of a software engineer. Therefore, it's
                        crucial to identify your target audience and
                        compile a list of words that are relevant to
                        your needs and interests. I recommend creating
                        a list of words that feel natural for you to
                        use and practice saying them regularly. Below
                        I've compiled a few categories that I think are
                        essential, pick the most common of each and
                        practice them repeatedly:</p>

                      <div>
                        <p>This is a skill that I neglected for a long
                        time. I would be afraid to make mistakes and
                        because of that fear I would focus more on what
                        I was saying or what I prepared to say than
                        what was being said by other people. If you
                        focus on what the other person is saying,
                        responding can feel much more natural and if
                        you make errors, they can help correct
                        them.</p>

                      <h4>Phrasal Construction</h4>
                      <div>
                        <p>By the end of the grammar section you should
                        have a decent idea of how sentences and phrases
                        are constructed in your TL, and by the end of
                        the vocab section you should have enough at
                        your disposal to begin constructing sentences
                        yourself, if you haven't already. I usually do
                        this by making a list of things I might say in
                        my NL and then translating them to the TL.</p>
